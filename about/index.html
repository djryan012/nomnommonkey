				<p>My name is Georgie, and while originally from the Bay Area, now reside in Orange County. Home of beautiful beaches and amazing sunsets! I met my husband in early 2012. We have two dogs, a scottie named MacKenzie and a boingle named Sable, a water turtle named Willie, a huge koi fish named Casper and 9 other smaller koi which I affectionately call the Jackson 5 because let&#8217;s face it, Tito had enough personality for 4 people!</p>
				<p>Cooking, baking, the outdoors are among my favorite things and I look forward to our annual ski trip to Mammoth!! My Gramms inspired me with her love of cooking and I will share with you all the secret ingredient, LOVE! If you make it with love, love for yourself, for those you are cooking/baking for and just for the love of what you are doing, it will always come out amazing!</p>
