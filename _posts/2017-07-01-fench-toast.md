A huge lover of French Toast, and one of my brother's favorites, I had him over for brunch and we chowed down! Mimosas are totally optional!

You will need the following:
<ul>
 	<li>6 large eggs</li>
 	<li>maple syrup (if you can get pure Canadian maple syrup, I personally think that is the best)</li>
 	<li>ground cinnamon (be sure to keep the bottle handy)</li>
 	<li>1 level tbsp nutmeg</li>
 	<li>1 pinch salt</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
 	<li>2 1/2 tbsp vanilla pure extract</li>
 	<li>extra virgin olive oil (be sure to keep the bottle handy)</li>
 	<li>1 medium loaf sourdough bread (minus the two end pieces. *** if you have sensitive teeth, choose a hearty yet soft crusted bread)</li>
 	<li>1/2 stick of butter, room temperature</li>
 	<li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream (be sure to use heavy cream, it adds richness and depth)</li>
 	<li>2 cookie sheets</li>
 	<li>medium sized non-stick pan (enough for 2 slices of bread)</li>
 	<li>confectioners sugar (powdered sugar)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Let's get started:
<ol>
 	<li>Preheat over at 200 degrees. This is so that you can put the toast in there as you make them so that they all stay warm for when you are ready to serve.</li>
 	<li>In a mixing bowl, whisk the following:
<ol>
 	<li>6 eggs</li>
 	<li>heavy cream</li>
 	<li>4 good heavy dashes of ground cinnamon</li>
 	<li>Â the tbsp of nutmeg</li>
 	<li>pinch of salt</li>
 	<li>the vanilla extract</li>
 	<li>the granulated sugar</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Next place a non-stick pan over low-medium heat.</li>
 	<li>Pour in a silver dollar size of olive oil and a thin slice of butter roughly a mm thin into the pan</li>
 	<li>Place 2 slices of bread in your mixture, coating both sides. Once coated, put in your heated pan</li>
 	<li>You will want to keep them on until the first side turns a light golden brown, and then flip so that the other side cooks</li>
 	<li>Continue this process for the rest of the bread, each time places the cooked pieces in the oven as they are done to stay warm until you are ready to serve</li>
 	<li>Once you have all the toast cooked and in the over keeping warm, what I like to do is to place a plate in the microwave for 30-40 seconds to get a little warmer than room temperature. Once you pull it out, sprinkle the plate with cinnamon and the confectioners sugar to add flavor on the bottom of the slices and it makes the plate look prettier.</li>
 	<li>As you heat a plate, you will plate the one you just pulled out of the microwave, i.e. sprinkle with cinnamon and powdered sugar, arranging the slices as you see fit on the plate. ***I would recommend if you are layering one on top of the other, sprinkle a little cinnamon in between each slice to give additional depth to the taste.</li>
 	<li>We have our syrup at room temperature. IF you would like to have yours warm, I would put in the microwave for 45 seconds whilst you are plating the french toast and keep covered so that it can stay warm.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, ENJOY!</li>
