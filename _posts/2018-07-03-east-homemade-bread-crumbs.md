title: "Easy Homemade Bread Crumbs-No More Store Bought!"

I love a good Chicken Parmesan, meatballs, meatloaf.... just the thought of these deliciousness is making me hungry! I have found that homemade breadcrumbs really take the taste level up a notch and give it a more savory taste.

This will be a recipe that you will read through, but will need to come back to unless you have a good amount of bread stocked up.

Ingredients:
<ul>
 	<li>Loaf of Bread- (if frozen, you will want to take it out from the freezer and put in the refrigerator over night to thaw so it is a slow thaw and the bread does not get mushy). *******I personally save all of the end pieces from the various bread we buy, whether it is sourdough, multi-grain, pumpernickel, etc. I take all the bread and freeze it as I collect and then can make a big batch.<em>***The more variations in bread you have, the better the taste </em></li>
 	<li>Jars- you can feel free to use anything you can get your hands on. Whether it is mason jars, or old jam jars (this is one of my personal favorites) or even plastic gelato containers would work (another personal favorite). Anything that is glass or a harder plastic that will seal in the flavor and keep moisture out.</li>
 	<li>Kosher Salt- this will depend on how big of a batch you are making. Generally you will be adding 1/4 tsp per cup of breadcrumbs</li>
 	<li>Italian Seasoning- this will follow suite with the salt.You will use 1/4 tsp per cup of breadcrumbs</li>
 	<li>Toaster</li>
 	<li>Cuisinart/food processor or blender if you do not have a food processor.</li>
</ul>
Let's begin!
<ol>
 	<li>Take the thawed bread and start toasting it in the toaster. You will want to have a mixture of light and medium brown piece, so be sure you are adjusting accordingly as you toast. DO NOT USE BURNED TOAST... this will not add to the taste, but rather take away from it</li>
 	<li>Once you have toasted all the bread, set aside to cool, in which ever method you would like (sitting on the counter, on a cooling rack, etc). It will take about 15 min for it to all cool.</li>
 	<li>Next, get your food processor ready. I have a Cuisinart so the instructions will be off of that, but the same will apply for a food processor or blender (I would recommend the pulse setting as this will mimic the food processor). You will want to start adding the bread with the machine on. You will need to break into hunks and drop in. As you do this, if you use a variation of breads you will start to see a beautiful mixture of color. Be sure to keep consistent with 1 cup of bread crumbs to 1 tsp of salt. You do not want the breadcrumbs to be too salty. If you want Italian Seasoned bread crumbs, you will add both the salt and the seasoning, 1/4 tsp each per cup.</li>
 	<li>You will most likely do this in batches depending on how much bread you have. I use breadcrumbs regularly, so I tend to make a big batch, 1 loaf at a time. The loaf makes roughly 4-4 1/2 medium sized mason jars</li>
 	<li>Make sure you store the bread crumbs in a dry and cool place</li>
</ol>
