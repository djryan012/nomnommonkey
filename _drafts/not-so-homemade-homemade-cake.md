One of the joys I have in my life is baking the monthly birthday cakes at work. However, with a busy schedule, and working full time I am always trying to find ways to cut corners in the baking world.

My go to is CAKE BOX MIX! You can use any kind that sounds good, you just have to make some key adjustments. My go to is Betty Crocker Super Moist Cake Mix.

Here are the adustments:
<ul>
 	<li>substitue the milk for water; if it states one cup water, use one cup milk instead</li>
 	<li>if it states to use 1/2 cup vegetable oil, add 2/3 olive oil</li>
 	<li>add 1-1 1/2 tbsp softened butter</li>
 	<li>2 tbsp mayonaise</li>
 	<li>if it is a yellow cake mix, you will want to add 1 tbsp of vanilla to give it that extra warmth</li>
 	<li>if it is a chocolate mix, you can add 1 tbsp of cocoa to give it a little extra richness in taste</li>
</ul>
The key is the extra fat...this is why the mayo, extra oil and butter is key. Using oilive oil instead of vegetable oil gives it a little extra depth in flavor. The vanilla and cocoa is all about warmth and that extra little something. You can even add a tbsp of almond extra to give it something extra if you are using a white or yellow mix instead of the vanilla to give t some warmth.
